    </p>

    <p>1. The NFTTunz Items</p>

    <p>
      NFTTunz.io (“nfttunz.io”) is comprised of a distributed and
      deterministic Layer 2 Smart Contract protocol operated chiefly by
      Hive-Engine.com and a user facing interface available at nfttunz.io. The
      web interface and the Layer 2 Smart Contract platform runs on the Hive
      Blockchain as the base layer of the application. Verification of account
      ID and keys are done by the Hive blockchain and the ability to post custom
      JSON transactions to the Hive blockchain. These custom JSON transactions
      are used to operate contracts that operate within the Hive-Engine smart
      contract platform. The Layer 2 smart contract platform uses
      specially-developed smart contracts (each, a “Layer 2 Smart Contract”) to
      enable users to create, buy, transfer and trade unique digital art, which
      can then be visualized on a website that the user can interact with the
      Site. The Layer 2 Smart Contracts and the Site are collectively referred
      to in these Terms as the “App”. Using the App, users can view their art
      and use the Layer 2 Smart Contracts to create, acquire, and trade art with
      other App users.
    </p>

    <p>
      You affirm that you are aware and acknowledge that nfttunz.io is a
      non-custodial provider of software services that has developed this
      distributed and decentralized environment where the App can be
      autonomously and directly accessed by the Users without any involvement or
      actions taken by nfttunz.io or any third-party.
    </p>

    <p>A. Creation</p>

    <p>
      * nfttunz.io is an open platform for the creation of limited-edition
      digital items, (“nfttunz.io Items). These items include but are not
      limited to: visual artwork, animations, audio, photographs, or other
      original content.
    </p>

    <p>
      * The nfttunz.io platform allows users to exchange blockchain-based
      cryptographic, unique digital items between one another that may contain
      commercial rights to reproduce the work.
    </p>
    <p>
      * Original content creators can apply to be in our Verified Artist
      Network. Non-Verified Artists may be allowed to post creations that will
      show up on nfttunz.io, but we make no guarantees that they will be
      accepted as verified artists or artwork created by non-verified artists
      will be displayed.
    </p>
    <p>
      * If accepted, artists will be whitelisted as a verified contributor in
      our Layer 2 Smart Contracts, and can then issue unique tokens to represent
      their original NFTTunz.io Items.
    </p>
    <p>
      * The nfttunz.io Items can then be sold or transferred to other people.
    </p>
    <p>
      * When a nfttunz.io Item is purchased or transferred by a person, the
      Layer 2 Smart Contract Token that represents it is automatically
      transferred to the person’s Hive Wallet address.
    </p>

    <p>B. Ownership</p>

    <p>
      <em>Owning a nfttunz.io item is analogous to owning a physical artwork,
        like an original painting or print.</em>
    </p>

    <p>
      <em>Private Ownership, as defined by purchasing a Art Token specifically
        stating that the rights conferred are "Private," does not include
        intellectual property rights such as copyright claims, ability to
        produce commercially, and create merchandise therefrom, etc.</em>
    </p>

    <p>
      <em>The intellectual property remains the possession of the creator.</em>
    </p>

    <p>
      <em>Full Commercial Rights, as defined by purchasing an Art Token
        specifically stating that Full Commercial Rights are conferred are "Full
        Commercial Rights," which allows the purchaser to use the Art, and
        derivitives of the in commercial enterprise. Full Commercial Rights
        NEVER allow an owner to retokenize and essentially inflate the supply of
        the Art Token or any piece of the art for Sale on NFTTunz.io or any
        other platform that allows for tokenized art sales. Collectors found by
        the operators of nfttunz.io at their sole discretion may block the user
        from access to nfttunz.io.</em>
    </p>

    <p>
      <em>NFTTunz.io attempts our best to make sure that all nfttunz.io Items
        created on the platform are done so by their original creator, but we
        are not liable if someone breaks our terms and creates items of which
        they are not the original creator.</em>
    </p>

    <p>
      <em>Any asset that are downloaded via the Download High-res feature does
        not include intellectual property rights such as copyright claims,
        ability to produce commercially, and create merchandise therefrom, etc,
        unless it specifically states that Full Commercial Rights are granted
        with Art Token ownership.</em>
    </p>

    <p>2. The App</p>

    <p>
      A. To most easily use the App, you must first install the Google Chrome or
      Brave web browser. Once you have installed Chrome or Brave, you will need
      to install a browser extension called Hive-Keychain. Keychain is an
      electronic wallet, which allows you to transfer, store, and engage in
      transactions using the HIVE cryptocurrency, HIVE, and layer 2 Smart
      Contract Tokens built using the Hive Engine smart contract platform. You
      will not be able to engage in any transactions on the App other than
      through Hive-Keychain or HiveSigner. The App will only recognize you as a
      user, and you will only be able to interact with the App, if your Hive
      electronic wallet is connected and unlocked through your Hive Keychain
      extension. There is no other way to sign up as a user, or to interact
      directly with the App.
    </p>

    <p>
      B. Transactions that take place on the App are managed and confirmed via
      the Hive blockchain and Layer 2 Smart Contract platform. You understand
      that your Hive public address will be made publicly visible whenever you
      engage in a transaction on the App.
    </p>

    <p>
      C. We neither own nor control Hive, Hive Keychain, Hive-Engine, Google
      Chrome, Mozilla Firefox, or any other third party site, product, or
      service that you might access, visit, or use for the purpose of enabling
      you to use the various features of the App. We will not be liable for the
      acts or omissions of any such third parties, nor will we be liable for any
      damage that you may suffer as a result of your transactions or any other
      interaction with any such third parties.
    </p>

    <p>3. Modification of Agreement and Transfer</p>

    <p>
      This Agreement may be discretionarily modified or replaced at any time,
      unless stated otherwise herein. The most current version of this Agreement
      will be posted on the Site with the “Last Revised” date at the top of the
      Agreement changed. Any changes or modifications will be effective
      immediately upon posting the revisions to the Site. You shall be
      responsible for reviewing and becoming familiar with any such
      modifications. You waive any right you may have to receive specific notice
      of such changes or modifications. Use of the App by you after any
      modification to the Agreement constitutes your acceptance of the Agreement
      as modified. If you do not agree to the Agreement in effect when you
      access or use the App, We may, at any time and without liability or prior
      notice, modify or discontinue all or part of the App (including access to
      the App via any third-party links). Neither party may assign or transfer
      any rights or obligations under this Agreement without the prior written
      consent of the other party, provided that NFTTunz.io may assign this
      Agreement without your prior consent to any of NFTTunz.io affiliates, or
      to its successors in interest of any business associated with the services
      provided by nfttunz.io. This Agreement shall be binding upon the
      permitted assigns or transferees of each party.
    </p>

    <p>4. Fees and Payment</p>

    <p>
      A. If you elect to purchase, trade, or create art on the App, or with or
      from other users via the App, any financial transactions that you engage
      in will be conducted solely through the Hive blockchain and/or Hive Engine
      Layer 2 Smart Contract network via Hive Keychain (or other
      Ethereum-compatible wallets and browsers). We will have no insight into or
      control over these payments or transactions, nor do we have the ability to
      reverse any transactions. With that in mind, we will have no liability to
      you or to any third party for any claims or damages that may arise as a
      result of any transactions that you engage in via the App, or using the
      Layer 2 Smart Contracts, or any other transactions that you conduct via
      the Hive Blockchain, Hive Engine platform, or Hive Keychain.
    </p>

    <p>
      B. Each time you utilize a Layer 2 Smart Contract to conduct a transaction
      with another user via the App, you authorize us to collect a commission of
      10% of the total value of that transaction (each, a “Commission”). You
      acknowledge and agree that the Commission will be transferred directly to
      us through the Hive Blockchain and Layer 2 Smart Contract network built on
      the Hive Engline Smart Contract platform as part of your payment.
    </p>

    <p>
      C. As between us, you will be solely responsible to pay any and all sales,
      use, value-added and other taxes, duties, and assessments (except taxes on
      our net income) now or hereafter claimed or imposed by any governmental
      authority (collectively, “Taxes”) associated with your use of the App
      (including, without limitation, any Taxes that may become payable as the
      result of your ownership, transfer, or creation of any artworks). Except
      for income taxes levied on NFTTunz.io, you: (i) will pay or reimburse us
      for all national, federal, state, local or other taxes and assessments of
      any jurisdiction, including value added taxes and taxes as required by
      international tax treaties, customs or other import or export taxes, and
      amounts levied in lieu thereof based on charges set, services performed or
      payments made hereunder, as are now or hereafter may be imposed under the
      authority of any national, state, local or any other taxing jurisdiction;
      and (ii) shall not be entitled to deduct the amount of any such taxes,
      duties or assessments from payments made to us pursuant to these Terms.
    </p>

    <p>5. Ownership; Restrictions</p>

    <p>
      <em>Buying digital art on NFTTunz.io is akin to buying an original
        painting or print from an artist:</em>
    </p>

    <p>
      <em>It does not transfer the Artist’s copyright to the Collector, unless it
        specifically states in the NFT that Full Commercial Rights are
        granted.</em>
    </p>

    <p>
      <em>The Collector receives true ownership, that is, he or she acquires the
        right to display and resell the digital art to another collector if they
        wish.</em>
    </p>

    <p>
      <em>But the Artist does not give up copyright, meaning Collector cannot
        prevent artist from using it for continued commercial work, and
        Collector has no right to use it for commercial purposes.</em>
    </p>

    <p>
      A. You acknowledge and agree that we (or, as applicable, our licensors)
      own all legal right, title and interest in and to all elements of the App.
    </p>

    <p>
      The graphics, design, systems, methods, information, computer code,
      software, services, “look and feel”, organization, compilation of the
      content, code, data, and all other elements of the App (collectively, the
      NFTTunz.io Materials”) are owned by nfttunz.io, and are protected by
      copyright, trade dress, patent, and trademark laws, international
      conventions, other relevant intellectual property and proprietary rights,
      and applicable laws. All NFTTunz.io Materials are the copyrighted
      property of NFTTunz.io or its licensors, and all trademarks, service
      marks, and trade names contained in the NFTTunz.io Materials are
      proprietary to nfttunz.io or its licensors. Except as expressly set forth
      herein, your use of the App does not grant you ownership of or any other
      rights with respect to any content, code, data, or other materials that
      you may access on or through the App. We reserve all rights in and to the
      NFTTunz.io Materials not expressly granted to you in the Terms.
    </p>

    <p>
      For the sake of clarity, you understand and agree: (i) that your purchase
      of an artwork is like buying a print or original painting from an artist.
      It is yours to keep and enjoy, but it does not give you any rights or
      licenses in or to the artwork (including, without limitation, the
      copyright in and to the art and drawings associated with it) other than
      those expressly contained in these Terms; and (ii) that you do not have
      the right to reproduce, distribute, or otherwise commercialize any
      elements of the artwork (including, without limitation, the creator’s
      copyright in and to the art and drawings associated with it) in any way
      without the creator’s prior written consent in each case, which consent
      the creator may hold in their sole and absolute discretion, unless Full
      Commercial Rights are specifically transferred.
    </p>

    <p>
      B. You may choose to submit comments, bug reports, ideas or other feedback
      about the App, including without limitation about how to improve the App
      (collectively, “Feedback”). By submitting any Feedback, you agree that we
      are free to use such Feedback at our discretion and without additional
      compensation to you, and to disclose such Feedback to third parties
      (whether on a non-confidential basis, or otherwise). You hereby grant us a
      perpetual, irrevocable, non-exclusive, worldwide license under all rights
      necessary for us to incorporate and use your Feedback for any purpose.
    </p>

    <p>

      or using the App, and for any consequences thereof. You agree to use the

    <p>8. Limitation of Liability</p>

    <p>
      A. YOU ACKNOWLEDGE AND AGREE THAT YOU ASSUME FULL RESPONSIBILITY FOR YOUR
      USE OF THE APP. YOU ACKNOWLEDGE AND AGREE THAT ANY INFORMATION YOU SEND OR
      RECEIVE DURING YOUR USE OF THE APP MAY NOT BE SECURE AND MAY BE
      INTERCEPTED OR LATER ACQUIRED BY UNAUTHORIZED PARTIES. YOU UNDERSTAND AND
      AGREE THAT WE, OUR SUBSIDIARIES, AFFILIATES, AND LICENSORS WILL NOT BE
      LIABLE TO YOU OR TO ANY THIRD PARTY FOR ANY INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL,
      CONSEQUENTIAL, OR EXEMPLARY DAMAGES WHICH YOU MAY INCUR, HOWSOEVER CAUSED
      AND UNDER ANY THEORY OF LIABILITY, INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, ANY LOSS
      OF PROFITS (WHETHER INCURRED DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY), LOSS OF GOODWILL OR
      BUSINESS REPUTATION, LOSS OF DATA, COST OF PROCUREMENT OF SUBSTITUTE GOODS
      OR SERVICES, OR ANY OTHER INTANGIBLE LOSS, EVEN IF WE HAVE BEEN ADVISED OF
      THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.
    </p>

    <p>
      B. YOU AGREE THAT OUR TOTAL, AGGREGATE LIABILITY TO YOU FOR ANY AND ALL
      CLAIMS ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO THESE TERMS OR YOUR ACCESS TO OR USE
      OF (OR YOUR INABILITY TO ACCESS OR USE) ANY PORTION OF THE APP, WHETHER IN
      CONTRACT, TORT, STRICT LIABILITY, OR ANY OTHER LEGAL THEORY, IS LIMITED TO
      THE GREATER OF (A) THE AMOUNTS YOU ACTUALLY PAID nfttunz.io UNDER THESE
      TERMS IN THE 12 MONTH PERIOD PRECEDING THE DATE THE CLAIM AROSE, OR (B)
      $100.
    </p>

    <p>
      C. YOU ACKNOWLEDGE AND AGREE THAT WE HAVE MADE THE APP AVAILABLE TO YOU
      AND ENTERED INTO THESE TERMS IN RELIANCE UPON THE WARRANTY DISCLAIMERS AND
      LIMITATIONS OF LIABILITY SET FORTH HEREIN, WHICH REFLECT A REASONABLE AND
      FAIR ALLOCATION OF RISK BETWEEN THE PARTIES AND FORM AN ESSENTIAL BASIS OF
      THE BARGAIN BETWEEN US. WE WOULD NOT BE ABLE TO PROVIDE THE APP TO YOU
      WITHOUT THESE LIMITATIONS.
    </p>

    <p>9. Assumption of Risk</p>

    <p>You accept and acknowledge each of the following:</p>

    <p>
      A. The prices of blockchain assets are extremely volatile. Fluctuations in
      the price of other digital assets could materially and adversely affect
      the value of your nfttunz.io Items, which may also be subject to
      significant price volatility. We cannot guarantee that any purchasers of
      nfttunz.io Items will not lose money. You also acknowledge that the cost
      of transacting on such technologies is variable and may increase at any
      time causing impact to any activities taking place on the HIVE blockchain.
      You acknowledge these risks and represent that nfttunz.io cannot be held
      liable for such fluctuations or increased costs.
    </p>

    <p>
      B. You are solely responsible for determining what, if any, taxes apply to
      your nfttunz.io-related transactions. nfttunz.io is not responsible for
      determining the taxes that apply to your transactions on the App.
    </p>

    <p>
      C. The App does not store, send, or receive nfttunz.io Items. This is
      because nfttunz.io Items exist only by virtue of the ownership record
      maintained on the App’s supporting blockchain in the HIVE Blockchain and
      on the layer 2 smart contract platform via hive engine.Any transfer of
      NFTTunz.io Items occurs within the supporting blockchain in the HIVE
      blockchain and Layer 2 smart contracts, and not on the App.
    </p>

    <p>
      D. There are risks associated with using an Internet-based currency,
      including, but not limited to, the risk of hardware, software and Internet
      connections, the risk of malicious software introduction, and the risk
      that third parties may obtain unauthorized access to information stored
      within your wallet. You accept and acknowledge that nfttunz.io will not
      be responsible for any communication failures, disruptions, errors,
      distortions or delays you may experience when using the HIVE Blockchain or
      Hive Engine layer 2 smart contract platform, however caused.
    </p>

    <p>
      E. A lack of use or public interest in the creation and development of
      distributed ecosystems could negatively impact the development of the
      nfttunz.io ecosystem, and therefore the potential utility or value of
      nfttunz.io Items.
    </p>

    <p>
      F. The App, HIVE, digital items, and other digital assets could be
      impacted by one or more regulatory inquiries or regulatory action, which
      could impede or limit the ability of nfttunz.io to continue to develop,
      or which could impede or limit your ability to access or use the App or
      HIVE blockchain and or Hive Engine Layer 2 Smart Contract Platform,
      including access to your digital assets or other funds, and new
      regulations or policies may materially adversely affect the development of
      the nfttunz.io ecosystem, and therefore the potential utility or value of
      nfttunz.io.
    </p>

    <p>
      G. Upgrades by HIVE to the HIVE platform, a hard fork in the HIVE
      platform, or a change in how transactions are confirmed on the HIVE
      platform may have unintended, adverse effects on all blockchains using the
      Hive Engine Layer 2 Smart Contract platform, including the nfttunz.io
      ecosystem.
    </p>

    <p>
      H. You acknowledge and understand that Cryptography is a progressing
      field. Advances in code cracking or technical advances such as the
      development of quantum computers may present risks to cryptocurrencies,
      digital assets and the App, which could result in the theft or loss of
      your digital assets or nfttunz.io items. To the extent possible, it is
      intended to update the protocol underlying the App to account for any
      advances in cryptography and to incorporate additional security measures,
      but does not guarantee or otherwise represent full security of the system.
      By using the App, you acknowledge these inherent risks.
    </p>

    <p>
      I. You acknowledge that the App is subject to flaws and acknowledge that
      you are solely responsible for evaluating any code provided by the App.
      This warning and others provided in this Agreement by nfttunz.io in no
      way evidence or represent an ongoing duty to alert you to all of the
      potential risks of utilizing or accessing the App.
    </p>

    <p>
      J. Any use or interaction with the App requires a comprehensive
      understanding of applied cryptography and computer science in order to
      appreciate inherent risks, including those listed above. You represent and
      warrant that you possess relevant knowledge and skills. Any reference to a
      type of digital asset on the App does not indicate our approval or
      disapproval of the underlying technology regarding such type of digital
      asset, and should not be used as a substitute for your own understanding
      of the risks specific to each type of digital asset. We make no warranty
      as to the suitability of the digital assets referenced on the App and
      assume no fiduciary duty in our relations with you.
    </p>

    <p>
      K. Use of the App, in particular for creating, buying or selling trading
      digital assets, may carry financial risk. digital assets are, by their
      nature, highly experimental, risky, volatile and transactions carried
      through the App are irreversible, final and there are no refunds. You
      acknowledge and agree that you will access and use the App at your own
      risk. The risk of loss in trading digital assets can be substantial. You
      should, therefore, carefully consider whether such creating, buying or
      selling digital assets is suitable for you in light of your circumstances
      and financial resources. By using the App, you represent that you have
      been, are and will be solely responsible for making your own independent
      appraisal and investigations into the risks of a given transaction and the
      underlying digital assets. You represent that you have sufficient
      knowledge, market sophistication, professional advice and experience to
      make your own evaluation of the merits and risks of any transaction
      conducted via the App or any underlying digital asset. You accept all
      consequences of using the App, including the risk that you may lose access
      to your digital assets indefinitely. All transaction decisions are made
      solely by you. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement, we accept no
      responsibility whatsoever for and will in no circumstances be liable to
      you in connection with use of the App for performing digital asset
      transactions. Under no circumstances will the operation of all or any
      portion of the App be deemed to create a relationship that includes the
      provision or tendering of investment advice.
    </p>

    <p>
      L. You are aware of and accept the risk of operational challenges. The App
      may experience sophisticated cyber-attacks, unexpected surges in activity
      or other operational or technical difficulties that may cause
      interruptions to or delays on the App. You agree to accept the risk of the
      App failure resulting from unanticipated or heightened technical
      difficulties, including those resulting from sophisticated attacks, and
      you agree not to hold us accountable for any related losses. We will not
      bear any liability, whatsoever, for any damage or interruptions caused by
      any viruses that may affect your computer or other equipment, or any
      phishing, spoofing or other attack. We advise the regular use of a
      reputable and readily available virus screening and prevention software.
      We do not guarantee that the App is or will remain updated, complete,
      correct or secure, or that access to the App will be uninterrupted. The
      App may include inaccuracies, errors and materials that violate or
      conflict with this Agreement. Additionally, third parties may make
      unauthorized alterations to the App or the software underlying the App.
      Accordingly, you should verify all information on the App before relying
      on it, and all decisions based on information contained on the App are
      your sole responsibility and we will have no liability for such decisions.
    </p>

    <p>10. Indemnification</p>

    <p>
      You agree to indemnify, defend and hold harmless nfttunz.io and its
      subsidiaries, affiliates, officers, agents, employees, advertisers,
      licensors, suppliers or partners from and against any claim, liability,
      loss, damage (actual and consequential) of any kind or nature, suit,
      judgment, litigation cost, and attorneys’ fees arising out of or in any
      way related to (i) your breach of these Terms, (ii) your misuse of the
      App, (iii) your violation of applicable laws, rules, regulations or the
      rights of any third party and (iv) any of your acts or omissions that
      implicate publicity rights, defamation or invasion of privacy in
      connection with your access to or use of the App. nfttunz.io reserves the
      right, at its own expense, to assume exclusive defense and control of any
      matter otherwise subject to indemnification by you and, in such case, you
      agree to cooperate with nfttunz.io in the defense of such matter.
    </p>

    <p>11. External Sites</p>

    <p>
      The App may include hyperlinks to other websites or resources
      (collectively, “External Sites”), which are provided solely as a
      convenience to our users. We have no control over any External Sites. You
      acknowledge and agree that we are not responsible for the availability of
      any External Sites, and that we do not endorse any advertising, products
      or other materials on or made available from any External Sites.
      Furthermore, you acknowledge and agree that we are not liable for any loss
      or damage which may be incurred as a result of the availability or
      unavailability of the External Sites, or as a result of any reliance
      placed by you upon the completeness, accuracy or existence of any
      advertising, products or other materials on, or made available from, any
      External Sites.
    </p>

    <p>12. Changes to the Terms</p>

    <p>
      We may make changes to the Terms from time to time. When we make changes,
      we will make the updated Terms available on the App and update the “Last
      Updated” date at the beginning of these Terms accordingly. Please check
      these Terms periodically for changes. Any changes to the Terms will apply
      on the date that they are made, and your continued access to or use of the
      App after the Terms have been updated will constitute your binding
      acceptance of the updates. If you do not agree to any revised Terms, you
      may not access or use the App.
    </p>

    <p>13. Children</p>

    <p>
      You affirm that you are over the age of 13, as the App is not intended for
      children under 13. IF YOU ARE 13 OR OLDER BUT UNDER THE AGE OF 18, OR THE
      LEGAL AGE OF MAJORITY WHERE YOU RESIDE IF THAT JURISDICTION HAS AN OLDER
      AGE OF MAJORITY, THEN YOU AGREE TO REVIEW THESE TERMS WITH YOUR PARENT OR
      GUARDIAN TO MAKE SURE THAT BOTH YOU AND YOUR PARENT OR GUARDIAN UNDERSTAND
      AND AGREE TO THESE TERMS. YOU AGREE TO HAVE YOUR PARENT OR GUARDIAN REVIEW
      AND ACCEPT THESE TERMS ON YOUR BEHALF. IF YOU ARE A PARENT OR GUARDIAN
      AGREEING TO THE TERMS FOR THE BENEFIT OF A CHILD OVER 13, THEN YOU AGREE
      TO AND ACCEPT FULL RESPONSIBILITY FOR THAT CHILD’S USE OF THE APP,
      INCLUDING ALL FINANCIAL CHARGES AND LEGAL LIABILITY THAT HE OR SHE MAY
      INCUR.

    <p>Privacy policy</p>

    <p>Last Updated: 17 June 2020</p>

    <p>
      We at nfttunz.io believe your privacy is highly important, and we have
      written this privacy policy (this “Policy”) to reflect our values, and to
      clearly describe what information we collect from you when you use our
      specially-developed smart contracts to enable users to create, buy,
      transfer and trade unique digital art, which can then be visualized on a
      website (https://nfttunz.io) that users can interact with (the “Site”),
      as well as how we protect and use that information. The smart contracts
      and the Site are collectively referred to in this Policy as the “App”. By
      using the App, you agree that we can collect, use, disclose, and process
      your information as described in this Policy. This Policy only applies to
      the App, and not to any other websites, products or services you may be
      able to access or link to via the App. We encourage you to read the
      privacy policies of any other websites you visit before providing your
      information to them.
    </p>

    <p>
      While our values will not shift, the App will evolve over time, and this
      Policy will change to reflect that evolution. If we make changes, we will
      notify you by revising the date at the top of this Policy. In some cases,
      if we make significant changes, we may give you additional notice by
      adding a statement to our homepage, or by sending you an email
      notification. We encourage you to review this Policy periodically to stay
      informed about our practices.
    </p>

    <p>Information Collection</p>
    <p>Information We Do Collect</p>

    <p>
      We may ask you to provide us with your email address, discord user name,
      and your Hive Wallet address. We also collect basic information when you

      access times, IP address, hardware model, operating system and version,
      and other unique device identifiers. Some of these third-party providers
      may place cookies or pixels — small data files stored on your hard drive
      or in device memory — on your browser or hard drive. Note that this Policy
      does not cover the use of cookies or pixels by such third parties. Most
      web browsers are set to accept cookies and pixels by default, but you can
      usually set your browser to remove or reject browser cookies or pixels. If
      you do choose to remove or reject cookies or pixels, however, your ability
      to use the App might be affected.
