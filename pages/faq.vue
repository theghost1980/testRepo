      header="What does NFTTunz.io offer?"
    >
      The Hive blockchain is optimal for NFT trading. Transactions are free and
      3 second block times means all transactions resolve very quickly.
    </b-card>

    <b-card class="mt-3" header="What is an NFT?">
      NFT stands for non-fungible token. Anytime you have a token and you're
      keeping track of more details than who owns them and how many, then you
      have a non-fungible token. In this case we're keeping track of the music,
      who owns it, when it was created, a description etc. All of that data
      lives in the token, which is what you're purchasing when you buy the music.
      More info at

      NFT creation costs 5 Hive + 1 Hive per edition. Upon completion of the
      initial sale NFTTunz.io collects a 10% commission. Upon completion of
      secondary market sales NFTTunz.io collects a 10% comission and pays half of
      that as a royalty to the original artist.

      header="What is Hive-Engine and why do we need it?"
    >
      Hive Engine is a smart contract platform built on the Hive Blockchain.

    <b-card
      class="mt-3"
      header="What is Swap.Hive?"
    >
      The Hive blockchain uses the HIVE cryptocurrency as the medium of
      exchange. Hive-Engine utilizes a HIVE backed token called "Swap.Hive" to
      execute all the smart contracts. To interact with NFTTunz.io users are
      required to convert Hive to SWAP.HIVE. You can do this at Hive-Engine.com
      and sign in with the Hive Keychain browser extension you've already
      installed.

    >
      Most regular websites require a username and password. Blockchains
      require you to have keys. Keys are long strings of numbers and letters
      that are unique to you. If you lose your keys you'll be unable to access
      your accounts.

      the blockchain like make music NFTs or blog about the experience, and are
      regenerated over time when no actions are performed.

      class="mt-3"
      header="What is Keychain?"
    >

    <b-card
      class="mt-3"
      header="How NFTTunz.io Works."
    >
      On NFTTunz.io artists can create digital tokens with unique features that
      can be sold to collectors. Collectors can gather limited edition music
      pieces from popular artists. You can create, buy, sell and trade these
      tokens.
    </b-card>

    <b-card
      class="mt-3"
      header="Who owns my creations?"
    >
      As the creator of the token you have digital ownership of your work. When
      you sell the work you can choose a private sale or Full Commercial Rights.
      When the music is sold as Private the collector owns that single piece of
      music but does not have the right to reproduce it on other sites. If the
      creator chooses Full Commercial Rights then the collector has full
      commercial rights to reproduce the music for profit and display it on
      commercial sites.
    </b-card>

    <b-card
      class="mt-3"
      header="Should I upload my high resolution digital files?"
    >
      NFTTunz.io currently allows uploads up to 30 mb. We suggest uploading the
      highest resolution possible while staying below that limit.
    </b-card>

    <b-card
      class="mt-3"
      header="Where are my creations stored?"
    >
      Art files are initially stored on the Hive image server managed by
      @blocktrades. As the project gains traction NFTTunz.io will have it's own
      image server.
    </b-card>

    <b-card
      class="mt-3"
      header="Can I gift my creation?"
    >
      Yes, and you can leave a custom note when gifting.

      Edition. If you issue your token with 15 copies then you have created a
      total of 15 Digital Editions.
    </b-card>

      header="Why is the sale price in SWAP.HIVE?"
    >
      The smart contract platfrom Hive-Engine, which is the backend of the
      NFTTunz.io website, requires that all contracts be settled in
      SWAP.HIVE.
    </b-card>

    <b-card
      class="mt-3"
      header="If I sell using NFTTunz.io, can I sell the same creations elsewhere?"
    >
      By creating an NFT with a specified number of editions you are ensuring
      the scarcity of your art for your buyers. Once an item is tokenized it's
      important you do not tokenize the same creation again as that will
      negatively affect the value of your artwork and reputation.
      <br>We reserve the right to restrict access to NFTTunz.io if an artist is
      caught fraudently issuing additional tokens of the same creation.

      Buying on NFTTunz.io

    >
      You're buying a token that contains limited edition, collectible art by

    <b-card
      class="mt-3"
      header="How does bidding work?"
    >
      Bids are not yet operational, but as it becomes available collectors will
      bid on art they want to purchase. Once a collector bids on a piece of art
      a 24 hour timer is started. If no new bids come in the collector will
      successfully purchase the art. If a new bid comes in then it will cause
      the original bid to be refunded and the 24 hour timer will restart. This
      process will repeat until there is no additional bidder within a 24 hour
      period at which point the sale will go through.
    </b-card>

    <b-card
      class="mt-3"
      header="Where do my purchased creations live?"
    >
      There is a `collection` tab in the website. You can see all the art you
      own there. If you're looking for a more technical answer the tokens live
      on the Hive-Engine side chain in a layer 2 on top of the Hive
      blockchain.
    </b-card>

    <b-card
      class="mt-3"
      header="Refund Policy"

      class="mt-3"
      header="Can I download or put this art on websites if I don't own it?"
    >
      Yes, as long as it's not being used in a commercial endeavor. So, if
      you're blogging about it or sharing a picture on social media that's ok,
      but it is recommended to be respectful of the artist and ask permission.
      Attempting to sell this art without securing the rights is not in
      compliance with the Terms of Service.
